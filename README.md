# Introduction

KVM Network Emulation with Configs Handling and Templates (KNECHT) is a tool I’ve been using for a while to build networking labs. 

There are well known tools for labs like GNS3 and EVE-NG. While they have a lot of advantages, such as the graphical interface and support for a lot of different OS, they also got some fatal flaws which make them sometimes a big pain to use, for example:

* Device access via console rather than SSH - makes config management very unreliable, configs are often lost
* Possible, but not very easy to connect external networks - makes difficult to do labs with automation tools or a mix of hardware, virtual devices and containers
* Topology config files are not quite human readable and get corrupted easily


KNECHT is a python script which uses libvirt API to create VM and virtual topologies, and NAPALM for config management. Topologies are stored in simple yaml files, configs can be exported and then imported into another lab or into hardware devices.

# Installation

1) Make sure the host has sufficient CPU and memory to run VMs. It makes little sense to try with less than 8 CPU cores and 16GB RAM, although for some labs (e.g. with XRv9k) you will need much more than that. 

If running nested virtualization, verify that VT-x/VT-d or AMD-v is enabled

```
grep --color --perl-regexp 'vmx|svm' /proc/cpuinfo
```

Some network OS (e.g. Cisco IOS-XR) are very I/O intensive, so you must use an SSD to be able to run them.

2) Install software used by libvirt and knecht:

```
apt-get install qemu qemu-kvm qemu-system qemu-utils libvirt-clients libvirt-daemon-system virtinst libguestfs-tools python3-pip 
pip3 install pyyaml napalm

virsh net-start default
virsh net-autostart default
```

3) Clone knecht and related scripts:

```
wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/routingcraft/knecht/master/knecht -P /usr/local/bin/
wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/routingcraft/knecht/master/knecht.yml -P /etc/
chmod +x /usr/local/bin/knecht
```

Also download bash scripts: fixeos.sh (for Arista vEOS), fixvms.sh (for Juniper vMX), fixvqfx.sh (for Juniper vQFX). Those are not mandatory, but make adding new images more convenient (see below).

topology.yml and nodes.yml are sample config files, the likes of which you can use for each lab

4) If planning to use Juniper - recompile linux kernel to enable UFS write support (see below). This is not mandatory, but if UFS write support is not enabled, you will have to manually paste basic configs when adding each new vMX image.

# Usage

The 2 files you downloaded are /usr/local/bin/knecht (script itself, should be somewhere in $PATH), and /etc/knecht.yml - the global settings file. It has the following settings.

File names for node and network topology config:

```
node_config: "nodes.yml"
topology_config: "topology.yml"
```

Directory in which KNECHT will be looking for the 2 files above, as well as device configs - by default, current directory:

```
working_dir: currentDir
```

Directory, where image templates are stored:

```
image_dir: "/var/lib/libvirt/images/"
```

Libvirt API (see /etc/libvirt/libvirt.conf) -  by default, system socket:

```
libvirt_api: "qemu:///system"
```

Management network, where libvirt assigns DHCP addresses to VMs.

```
mgmt_network: "default"
```

Then there are default vcpu/memory and network driver settings for all supported images.

## Nodes and topology configs

With settings above, create a separate directory for each new lab. It must have 2 files: nodes.yml and topology.yml

nodes.yml:

```
- R1:
    type: iosxe
    version: latest
    vcpu: 1
    memory: 3072
- R2:
    type: iosxrv
    version: latest
- SW1:
    type: eos
- SW2:
    type: eos
    version: 4.20.15M
    vcpu: 1
    memory: 2048
    network_driver: e1000
- R3:
    type: junosvmx
    version: 18.3R1.9
```

The only required parameter is “type” - must be one of the known_images. If version is not specified, latest available will be used. If vcpu/memory/network_driver not specified, the settings from /etc/knecht.yml for the relevant image type will be used. 

topology.yml:

```
- net1:
    SW1: 1
    SW2: 1
- net2:
    SW1: 2
    SW2: 2
- net3:
    R1: 3
    SW1: 3
- net4:
    R2: 3
    SW2: 3
- net5:
    SW1: 4
    SW2: 4
    R3: 2
```

This represents:

![Topology1.png](https://github.com/routingcraft/knecht/blob/master/images/Topology1.png)

## Using the lab

From the directory with lab configs, start the lab:

```
root@knecht:/home/dima/labs/lab4# knecht run
Starting topology defined in /home/dima/labs/lab4/nodes.yml and /home/dima/labs/lab4/topology.yml
Generating KVM XML config for R1
Generating KVM XML config for R2
Generating KVM XML config for SW1
Generating KVM XML config for SW2
Generating KVM XML config for R3
Generating KVM XML config for R3-vFP
```

Note that 2 VM were generated for R3 - this is because Juniper vMX consists of 2 separate images for vCP and vFP. KNECHT will take care of those and add data plane interfaces to vFP, while config handling will interact with vCP.

```
root@knecht:/home/dima/labs/lab4# virsh list
 Id   Name     State
------------------------
 7    R1       running
 8    R2       running
 9    SW1      running
 10   SW2      running
 11   R3       running
 12   R3-vFP   running
```

Wait until the lab boots up and all devices get DHCP addresses. Check with “knecht leases”, or “knecht ssh list":

```
root@knecht:/home/dima/labs/lab4# knecht ssh list
R1         ssh admin@192.168.122.50
R2         ssh admin@192.168.122.74
SW1        ssh admin@192.168.122.230
SW2        ssh admin@192.168.122.49
R3         ssh admin@192.168.122.71
```

For troubleshooting purposes, you can access the devices via console - e.g. “virsh console R1”


SSH to those IP, or open more tabs, cd to the lab directory and do “knecht ssh <vm>”:

```
root@knecht:/home/dima/labs/lab4# knecht ssh SW1
Warning: Permanently added '192.168.122.230' (ECDSA) to the list of known hosts.
vEOS#
```

If the images were properly added (as described below), SSH with public key authentication should work.

Once done with the lab, save configs and kill the lab:

```
root@knecht:/home/dima/labs/lab4# knecht save
Saving config for nodes defined in /home/dima/labs/lab4/nodes.yml to directory /home/dima/labs/lab4/
Saved R1 config to /home/dima/labs/lab4/R1_config.txt

Saved SW1 config to /home/dima/labs/lab4/SW1_config.txt
Saved SW2 config to /home/dima/labs/lab4/SW2_config.txt
Saved R3 config to /home/dima/labs/lab4/R3_config.txt

root@knecht:/home/dima/labs/lab4# knecht destroy

Removed /home/dima/labs/lab4/R3-vfp.img
```

When you run the same lab next time, wait until all the nodes boot and get IP, then load configs:

```
root@knecht:/home/dima/labs/lab4# knecht load
Loading config into nodes defined in /home/dima/labs/lab4/nodes.yml from directory /home/dima/labs/lab4/

Loaded /home/dima/labs/lab4/SW2_config.txt config into SW2
Loaded /home/dima/labs/lab4/R3_config.txt config into R3
```

# Connecting 3rd party devices

Every network KNECHT creates is a libvirt network. It is possible to connect it to other VM, containers or physical interfaces. You can bridge 3rd party VMs to existing networks, or create a dedicated network between a node spawned by KNECHT and your VM or container.

## Connect a VM

Add a network where the 3rd party VM will be connected.

topology.yml:

```
- net2:
    R2: 10
```

If the 3rd party VM was created by libvirt, attach it to the network using virsh:

```
virsh attach-interface --domain 3rdparty_vm --source net2 --type network --model e1000 --config --live
```

Some VM will require reboot in order to see the new interface. 

The method below works for non-libvirt VM, docker containers and physical interfaces.

## Connect a docker container

Check libvirt bridge name:

```
virsh net-info net2 | grep Bridge
Bridge:         virbr2
```

Create a docker bridge and connect your container to it:

```
docker network create knecht_bridge
docker network connect knecht_bridge 09b322bcf7a4
```

Create a veth pair and use them to connect these 2 bridges:

```
ip link add veth-knecht type veth peer name veth-docker
brctl add br-8a4ce9832a37 veth-docker
brctl addif virbr2 veth-knecht
ip link set dev veth-docker up
ip link set dev veth-knecht up
```

The resulting virtual topology is as follows:

![Docker_bridge.png](https://github.com/routingcraft/knecht/blob/master/images/Docker_bridge.png)

## Connect a physical interface

Check libvirt bridge name and connect interface to it:

```
virsh net-info net2 | grep Bridge
Bridge:         virbr2

brctl addif virbr2 ens33
```

## Connect a remote device over VXLAN

This is useful when you have to bridge virtual topology to physical devices, but can be also used to reach VM/containers on another host.

For example interface 10 of R2 will be connected to a remote hardware router.

topology.yml:

```
- net2:
    R2: 10
```

The IP of the host running KNECHT is 192.168.200.200, there is a remote Arista switch with IP 192.168.200.201 on Et1 and 192.168.255.255 on Lo0. 

Topology:

![OVS_bridge.png](https://github.com/routingcraft/knecht/blob/master/images/OVS_bridge.png)

Install OVS:

```
apt-get install openvswitch-switch
```

Check local bridge name:

```
virsh net-info net2 | grep Bridge
Bridge:         virbr2
```

Create OVS bridge, and connect it to the libvirt bridge using a veth pair:

```
ovs-vsctl add-br br0
ip link set dev br0 up
ip link add veth-knecht type veth peer name veth-ovs
ip link set dev veth-knecht up
ip link set dev veth-ovs up
brctl addif virbr2 veth-knecht
ovs-vsctl add-port br0 veth-ovs
```

Now add a route to the remote VTEP and configure VXLAN:

```
ovs-vsctl add-port br0 vxlan1 -- set interface vxlan1 type=vxlan options:key=1 options:remote_ip=192.168.255.255
ip route add 192.168.255.255/32 via 192.168.220.201
```

Remote Arista config:

```
interface Ethernet1
   no switchport
   ip address 192.168.220.201/24
!
interface Loopback0
   ip address 192.168.255.255/32
!
interface Vxlan1
   vxlan source-interface Loopback0
   vxlan udp-port 4789
   vxlan vlan 1 vni 1
   vxlan flood vtep 192.168.220.200
```

This will bridge all untagged traffic between R2 and physical hosts connected to Arista access ports on vlan 1, using VNI 1. It is possible to bridge only tagged traffic for some vlans by configuring VXLAN:VNI mappings.


# Tcpdump/Wireshark

Check bridge name for the given net:

```
# virsh net-info net1 | grep Bridge
Bridge:         virbr1
```

You can run tcpdump on virbr1. Or, as in my case, from local machine (Mac OS), run wireshark and redirect tcpdump via SSH tunnel:

```
ssh root@192.168.0.122 "tcpdump -s 0 -Un -w - -i virbr1" | wireshark -k -i -
```

# Ansible

Since all supported images have SSH access, it is possible to use ansible to provision configs. Just run "knecht ansible-hosts" - this will generate entries for /etc/hosts (they are needed because every time you run the lab, DHCP will assign different IP to VMs), and basic ansible config for /etc/ansible/hosts - might come in handy when you configure ansible for the first time for the given lab. Then you don’t need it as probably there will be your own group_vars or host_vars config for this topology.

# Supported images

This section explains how to create image templates for each supported network OS. These templates allow you to access lab VMs via SSH, use builtin knecht save/load commands (using NAPALM) or any 3rd party config provisioning tool like ansible. 

## Arista EOS

This is the most straightforward and adding new EOS images can be easily automated. Download veos-lab and aboot images. Convert vmdk to qcow2:

```
qemu-img convert -f vmdk -O qcow2 vEOS-lab-4.22.6M.vmdk hda.qcow2
```

Create a directory in the veos-<version> format and copy both files there. Then run the script fixeos.sh.

```
cd /var/lib/libvirt/images
mkdir veos-4.24.2F
mv Aboot-veos-serial-8.0.0.iso veos-4.24.2F/cdrom.iso
mv hda.qcow2 veos-4.24.2F/
./fixeos.sh veos-4.24.2F
```

Strictly speaking, separate Aboot ISO is not needed for newer IOS, but it won’t hurt. fixeos.sh will mount hda.qcow2 and write a basic startup config in it, which includes DHCP client, multi-agent routing mode, eAPI,  username admin/admin and, if id_rsa.pub exists in ~/.ssh/ on local machine, the script will configure username admin to authenticate with your public key. 

**Note:** even though KNECHT sets linux bridge MTU to 10000, vEOS-lab has a limitation: in order for jumbo frames to pass through, you must set vmnicet interfaces MTU from bash shell. E.g.

```
vEOS(config-if-Et3)#mtu 9214
vEOS(config-if-Et3)#bash sudo ip link set dev vmnicet3 mtu 9214
```

## Cisco IOS/IOS-XE

Cisco and automation don’t go well together. Adding new Cisco images involves some manual work unfortunately.

This covers vIOS images (for VIRL) and CSR1000v images. The former are particularly useful as CE routers due to low resource requirements.

For vIOS, convert the vmdk (if applicable), create a directory in the vios-<version> format and copy both files there:

```
qemu-img convert -f vmdk -O qcow2 vios-adventerprisek9-m.vmdk.SPA.155-3.M hda.qcow2
rm vios-adventerprisek9-m.vmdk.SPA.155-3.M 
mkdir vios-155-3.M
mv hda.qcow2 vios-155-3.M/


virt-install \
--name ios \
--ram 512 \
--vcpus 1 \
--os-type=other \
--network bridge=virbr0 \
--nographics \
--import \
--disk path=/var/lib/libvirt/images/vios-155-3.M/hda.qcow2
```

For CSR1000v, create an empty qcow2 image, copy it to the iosxe-<version> directory and use .iso disk extracted from .ova to boot.
  
```
tar -xvf csr1000v-universalk9.17.02.01v.ova
qemu-img create -f qcow2 hda.qcow2 8G
mkdir iosxe-17.02.01
mv hda.qcow2 iosxe-17.02.01/

virt-install \
--name ios \
--ram 4096 \
--vcpus 2 \
--os-type=other \
--network bridge=virbr0,model=virtio \
--nographics \
--cdrom=/var/lib/libvirt/images/csr1000v-universalk9.17.02.01v-vga.iso \
--disk path=/var/lib/libvirt/images/iosxe-17.02.01/hda.qcow2
```

When prompted, select serial console

For both vIOS/IOS-XE - once the VM is booted, copy the following config:

```

no service password-encryption
!
hostname ios
!
vrf definition MGMT
 !
 address-family ipv4
 exit-address-family
!
enable password cisco
!
aaa new-model
!
aaa authorization exec default local
!
no ip domain lookup
ip domain name routingcraft.net
!
archive
 path flash:archive
 write-memory
username admin privilege 15 password 0 admin
!
lldp run
!
```
**```
!for vios, replace gi1 with gi0/0
```
```**
interface GigabitEthernet1
 no shutdown
 vrf forwarding MGMT
 ip address dhcp
!
ip ssh version 2
ip scp server enable
!
line con 0
 exec-timeout 0 0
 logging synchronous
line vty 0 4
 exec-timeout 0 0
 logging synchronous
 transport input ssh
!
event manager applet KEYGEN
 event syslog pattern "SYS-5-RESTART"
 trigger delay 60
 action 1.0 cli command "enable"
 action 2.0 cli command "conf t"
 action 3.0 cli command "crypto key generate rsa modulus 2048"
```

If you have a public key (~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub), add it for user admin:

```
vios#conf t
Enter configuration commands, one per line.  End with CNTL/Z.
vios(config)#ip ssh pubkey-chain
vios(conf-ssh-pubkey)#username admin
vios(conf-ssh-pubkey-user)#key-string

```
Now paste only they key (without “ssh rsa” and “username@host” in the end). You might have to split it in multiple strings, otherwise IOS will not accept it).

Save config and destroy VM:

```
virsh destroy ios
virsh undefine ios
```

## Cisco IOS-XRv/XRv9000

There are 2 types of IOS-XR images: legacy XRv and newer XRv9000. The legacy images are still very useful for labs due to much lower resource requirements than XRv9000 (2 vs 16 GB RAM, 1 vs 4 vCPU). Also they can run multicast and mVPN. But only XRv9000 supports newer features like SR-TE and PCEP. Similarly to Cisco IOS images, preparing these for the first time involves a bit of manual work.

If you have a public key - change it to the binary form.

```
cat ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub | cut -f 2 -d ' ' | base64 -d > id_rsa.bin
```

Then get .vmdk, convert it to .qcow2, copy it into the iosxrv-<version> or iosxrv9000-<version> directory.

XRv:

```
qemu-img convert -f vmdk -O qcow2 iosxrv-k9-demo-5.3.0.vmdk hda.qcow2
mkdir iosxrv-5.3.0
mv hda.qcow2 iosxrv-5.3.0/

virt-install \
--name=xrv \
--disk path=/var/lib/libvirt/images/iosxrv-5.3.0/hda.qcow2,format=qcow2,bus=ide,cache=writethrough \
--vcpus=1 \
--ram=2048 \
--os-type=other \
--nographics \
--import
```

XRv9000:

```
mkdir iosxrv9000-7.0.1
tar -xvf xrv9k-fullk9-x-7.0.1.ova
qemu-img convert -f vmdk -O qcow2 disk1.vmdk hda.qcow2
mv hda.qcow2 iosxrv9000-7.0.1/

virt-install \
--name=xrv9000 \
--disk path=/var/lib/libvirt/images/iosxrv9000-7.0.1/hda.qcow2,format=qcow2,bus=ide,cache=writethrough \
--vcpus=4 \
--ram=16384 \
--os-type=other \
--nographics \
--import
```

The next steps are the same for both images.

Copy and commit the following config:

```
username admin
 secret 0 admin
!
vrf MGMT
!
line console
 exec-timeout 0 0
!
line default
 exec-timeout 0 0
!
interface MgmtEth0/RP0/CPU0/0
 no shutdown
 vrf MGMT
 ipv4 address dhcp
!
lldp
!
ssh server v2
ssh server vrf MGMT
xml agent tty iteration off
```

For old XRv - generate the local RSA key:

```
RP/0/RP0/CPU0:ios#crypto key generate rsa
```

Check the local IP and Import the SSH key:

```
RP/0/RP0/CPU0:ios#sh ipv4 int br
Mon Oct  5 16:47:56.062 UTC

Interface                      IP-Address      Status          Protocol Vrf-Name
MgmtEth0/RP0/CPU0/0            192.168.122.54  Up              Up       MGMT

scp id_rsa.bin admin@192.168.122.54:disk0:/

RP/0/RP0/CPU0:ios#crypto key import authentication rsa disk0:/id_rsa.bin
```

Destroy VM:

```
virsh destroy xrv
virsh undefine xrv
```

Also the local SSH client config must include DH and ciphers that are disabled by default as legacy IOS-XR supports only those.

~/.ssh/config:

```
Host *
    StrictHostKeyChecking no
    UserKnownHostsFile /dev/null
    ServerAliveInterval 60
    ServerAliveCountMax 10
    KexAlgorithms +diffie-hellman-group1-sha1
    Ciphers +aes128-cbc
```

## Juniper vMX

This is not as user friendly as EOS, but still can be automated to a decent degree. Download and untar vmx bundle, create a directory junosvmx-<version> and copy the following 4 files there:

```
cd /var/lib/libvirt/images
mkdir junosvmx-17.4R1
tar -xvf vmx-bundle-17.4R1-S4.2.tgz
cp vmx/images/junos-vmx-x86-64-17.4R1-S4.2.qcow2 junosvmx-17.4R1/virtioa.qcow2
cp vmx/images/vmxhdd.img junosvmx-17.4R1/virtiob.qcow2
cp vmx/images/metadata-usb-re.img junosvmx-17.4R1/virtioc.qcow2
cp vmx/images/vFPC-20180607.img junosvmx-17.4R1/vfpc.qcow2
rm -rf vmx
```

Now run virt-install for vCP. No need to worry about vFP for now.

```
virt-install \
--name vCP \
--ram 2048 \
--vcpus 2 \
--os-type=other \
--nographics \
--import \
--disk path=/var/lib/libvirt/images/junosvmx-17.4R1/virtioa.qcow2 \
--disk path=/var/lib/libvirt/images/junosvmx-17.4R1/virtiob.qcow2 \
--disk path=/var/lib/libvirt/images/junosvmx-17.4R1/virtioc.qcow2 \
--network=network:default,model=e1000 
```

It will try to boot and fail. This is expected.

```
virsh  list
 Id    Name                           State
----------------------------------------------------
 29    vCP                            paused

virsh destroy vCP
virsh start vCP
```

Now there are 2 options of what to do with it.

### Option 1: manually create basic config

After the vCP booted up 2nd time, go to console, login as root (no password), copy the basic config and destroy the VM. This will be your template used for other VM. The config must have credentials admin/Juniper, enabled SSH and DHCP client on fxp0.0.

```
virsh console vCP
Connected to domain vCP
Escape character is ^]

login: root

--- JUNOS 17.4R1-S4.2 Kernel 64-bit  JNPR-11.0-20180607.6534fbb_buil
root@:~ # cli
root>
```

Paste your config here and commit.

```
virsh destroy vCP
virsh undefine vCP
```

### Option 2: use script to generate config

**Note:** in order for this to work, linux kernel must be configured with UFS write support (CONFIG_UFS_FS_WRITE=y). Or if configuring with make menuconfig, navigate here > File systems > Miscellaneous filesystems > UFS file system write support. Also ufs and nbd kernel  modules must be available.


Once vMX has been installed (even without config), kill it:

```
virsh destroy vCP
virsh undefine vCP
```

Then run:

```
./fixvmx.sh junosvmx-17.4R1
```

This will mount virtiob.qcow2 (where config is stored), and create basic config with DHCP client on fxp0.0, SSH, username admin/Juniper, and fpc lite-mode. If id_rsa.pub exists in ~/.ssh on local machine, the script will also configure username admin to authenticate with your public key.

# Limitations

I wrote KNECHT to do routing labs. There is no goal to support anything apart from routing. This means, other things might work or not. For example, linux bridge does not forward LACP frames - see https://lists.linuxfoundation.org/pipermail/bridge/2010-January/006918.html. It is possible to patch and recompile it. 

# Troubleshooting

The code is ugly, but works. If you face any problems with VM not starting, being slow etc, they are most likely caused by poor performance of the host used for virtualization. Make sure Intel VT-x/VT-d/AMD-v is enabled in BIOS and, if running inside a VM, in the hypervisor; host has enough memory and CPU. Some VMs (e.g. Cisco XR) are very I/O intensive, so check with “top” if you see any “wa” (CPU waiting for disk I/O).


If you start the topology and get an error - e.g. because the requested image is not found, do **“knecht destroy”** before running the topology again. Otherwise on the 2nd run it may try to create objects it already created the previous time and fail again.

If you followed all installation steps but still getting errors, change the “debug” variable to True in /etc/knecht.yml, run the script again and send me the output.


When loading a config on Cisco IOS, you can get the following error:

```
OSError: Search pattern never detected in send_command_expect: (?:[>##]\s*$|.*all username.*confirm)
```

This can happen if IOS takes a very long time to do config replace. To fix this, increase global_delay_factor in netmiko parameters (NAPALM uses netmiko as driver for IOS). 

Open ios.py from NAPALM packages, find __init__ in the end, and add this line:

```
    def __init__(self, hostname, username, password, timeout=60, optional_args=None):
        """NAPALM Cisco IOS Handler."""
        if optional_args is None:
            optional_args = {}
```
**```
        optional_args["global_delay_factor"] = 5
```**
```
        self.hostname = hostname
        self.username = username
        self.password = password
        self.timeout = timeout
```
